every website has to have an index page (case-sensitive landing page).


# This is Karol's awesome website

This website is an example from [P8105](https://p8105.com/index.html) Data Science I. Learn more about this site [here](about.html).

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton for data science.

To show that you can use RMD like normal, check out [this page](plots.html) with plots.

.HEIC is not a supported web format, later use a png or jpg format.


## `_site.yml`

Create a single file with all the YAML stuff we need, and at the same time remove extraneous YAML header content from individual Rmd files.


## R Project
`Build Website` on Source (top-right), shortcut of `rmarkdown::render_site()`.This rebuilds the full website, whereas the knit button only rebuilds a page. Rebuilding the site can be useful if you’ve made big changes, like changing the `_site.yml`.

## Hosting on GitHub

Once you have a website! Except it exists only on your computer, so … not really a web site…

GitHub will recognize your repository as a website and host it as such.    
- If your repo is named <YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io, that’s your personal site address.     
- If your repo has another name, your site address will be <YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.       

Often this “just works”, but sometimes you have to update the repo settings for GitHub to know this is a website, especially for websites that are not <YOUR_GH_NAME>.github.io:

- Make sure you’ve pushed what you have to GitHub
- Log in to GitHub, find the repo, and navigate to repo settings
- Set the GitHub pages source to the main branch
